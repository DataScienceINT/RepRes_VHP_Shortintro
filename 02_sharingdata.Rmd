**Note: this half of the workshop we will split the participants based on their previous experience and tools they are using. If you can answer "yes" to the following questions, you are on the correct page:**

 - I don't use code (R, Python, Matlab, Julia,  etc) to analyse my data
 - I would like to use a tidy data format to make my data machine readable
 - I would like to use onedrive / google docs / similar software for version controlling my work.


## **Exercise B1: ** reflection {.blauw}

5-10 minutes

Go through your e-mail and look for the last time you sent some colleague or colaborator data or if all your data is shared in the cloud: the last time you uploaded new data. Suppose you move to a different university, your mailbox is closed and some stranger needs to use your data for a project. Would they have enough information to do so? What would you do differently next time?

Discuss in pairs of 2.

## Introduction
Whether you are working in an experimental, computational or design oriented scientific field, data is often either the final or at least an important product of your scientific research. When working in science, we seldom work in isolation, so sharing data and being able to track mutations and versions of the data and it's connected metadata should be an import aspect of your work. Because usually we grow into a project without having much education on very practical things such as where to store data, how to handle file structure, how to define versions of the data and how to handle mutations and version change, we decided to focus on these aspects in a very practical manner. 

In this part of the workshop, we will provide you with hands-on practical handles on how to collaborate on data. We will provide you with ways how to communicate on your data workflow and you will learn how to administer and track changes to your data. We will share some good practices on how to deal with sharing of data with others as well.

The contents of this part of the workshop:

 1. sharing and working with data in Excel
 1. Version control on data and text.
 1. Sending (and recieving) data via email and storing data online (Google Drive).


## Data flows in ONTOX

ONTOX is a data intensive project. Meaning, there is a lot of data collection going on in the project. While there are several ongoing developments to automate and standardize the data formats in ONTOX, many of us use a spreadsheet program such as MS Excel to gather and document data. In a large AI based project such as ONTOX, we need to keep in mind that the data does not only need to be understandable for us. It also needs to be machine readable (or at the very least: really easy to convert to machine readable data). Therefore, we will discuss how to best store data in tabular (in this case spreadsheet) formats.

## **Exercise B2: ** What can go wrong with data in Excel (groups of 3-5)

Exercise by [FAIR in (biological) practice course on carpentries-incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/05-intro-to-metadata/index.html#types-of-metadata). (see below for full reference)

15 minutes

Tables are one of the best forms of storing and representing information. That is why we find them almost everywhere, from a menu in a restaurant, a bank statement, to professional databases. No surprise then that we biologists love tables and we tend to predominantly use Excel.

Excel is easy to use, flexible and powerful, however, it often gives us too much freedom which leads to bad practices and difficult to re-use data and metadata.

Have a look at the following example data-file in Excel (you can download it [here](data/04-bad-excel.xlsx)):

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "900px"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here(
    "images",
    "bad-excel.png"))
```

It contains data similar to the presented data before from experiments on plants in different light conditions. Imagine you need to work with this file, and you got it emailed from a collaborator.

 1. What do you find confusing?
   What would you try to clarify with the author before doing anything with the file?
 1. What will be the issues with calculation of: average biomas, biomas per genotype?
 1. Typically, more advanced data analysis is done programmatically, which requires either conversion to text format as csv, tsv format or using a library that reads Excel files and “kind of makes this conversion on the fly”. Save this file in a text format, close Excel and reopen the saved files. What has changed?
 1. Have you seen similar tables? Do you believe this example is realistic and replicates real-life issues?

 1. This file hopefully unrealistically exacerbates typical bad practices in Excel.Some things that may be confusing: 
   - Why are there two tables, are the period measurement related to the metabolics i.e. same samples? 
   - Do colors in the period table have the same meaning? Seems no. 
   - Why can row 22 be read, whilst row 13 says error? 
   - What is the meaning of values in the media column? 
   - Are the genotypes the same in different blocks or not? 
   - What is the meaning behind bold text in the table? 
   - What is the definition of the terms/why are units missing/inconsistent? 
 1. - Before averaging the biomas weight, they need to get converted the same unit and the text needs to get replaced by the unit. - Averaging per genotype needs manual selection of suitable entries 
 1. - Information about light conditions is completely lost. - Header columns are scrambled. - The update date may change its meaning depending on the location (switch year with day).

## Some common spreadsheat errors (that have been spotted in ONTOX):
(shortened  and reworded accordingly slightly from source at carpentries-incubator.github.io)

 - **Not filling in zeros** 
It might be that when you’re measuring something, it’s usually a zero, say the number of times an adverse effect is observed in the survey. Why bother writing in the number zero in that column, when it’s mostly zeros? However, "I counted zero adverse effects" is diffent from "I did not measure this, this data is missing". Make sure to record zeros as zeros and truly missing data as empty / missing (so not -999, 999 and definately not 0. computers will conclude that there is data).
 - **Using formatting to convey information organizing data**
Never highlight cells, rows or columns that should be excluded from an analysis, or to mark particular properties/conditions. Also never merge cells. Formatting information is not available to analysis software and almost certainly will be lost during processing.
 - **Placing comments or units or more than one variable in a cell**
 Cells in a spreadsheet should contain one piece of information per cell.

## Tidy machine readable data

Tidy data is a way of organising your data in a neat and structured way. If you make your data tidy, it is ensured that it is machine readable. This is important in ONTOX, as we want to use the data to build an AI platform.

So what is tidy data:

1. Each variable must have its own column.  
1. Each observation must have its own row. 
1. Each value must have its own cell.

*Table1: Example of tidy data*

| country 	| year 	| population 	| birth rate 	|
|:---------	|:-----	|:----------	|:-----------	|
| mali    	| 2001 	| 10.000.000 	| 6.88       	|
| mali    	| 2010 	| 15.000.000 	| 6.06       	|
| sweden  	| 2001 	| 9.000.000  	| 1.57       	|
| sweden  	| 2010 	| 10.000.000 	| 1.85       	|


Each variable must have its own column.  

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03_4_tidy1.jpg")
```

Each observation must have its own row. 

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03_5_tidy2.jpg")
```

Each value must have its own cell.

```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03_6_tidy3.jpg")
```

So the following table would by untidy, as there are multiple observations per row:

*Table2: Example of untidy data*

| participant  	| sample1 	| sample2 	| sample3 	| sample4 	|
|:----------	|:------	|:--------	|:-------------	|:-----	|
| Pietje   	| 7.5  	| 6      	| 8.2         	| 8   	|
| Marietje 	| 8    	| 7.9    	| 5           	| 9   	|


This would be the tidy version:

*Table3: Example of untidy data made tidy*

| student  	| sample      	| stairs_walked 	|
|:----------	|:-------------	|:-------	|
| Pietje   	| 1        	| 7.5   	|
| Pietje   	| 2      	| 6     	|
| Pietje   	| 3 	| 8.2   	|
| Pietje   	| 4         	| 8     	|
| Marietje 	| 1        	| 8     	|
| Marietje 	| 2      	| 7.9   	|
| Marietje 	| 3 	| 5     	|
| Marietje 	| 4         	| 9     	|

## Version control on documents and data
You may know from experience how an unnoticed change in a document, the use of the wrong version or the loss of edits can lead to loss of time invested, frustration and above all confusion! This is why keeping a record on all mutations on a document or the data is important. There usually will be [quite a lot](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531). Especially, tracking mutations on the data is important for another reason: reproducibility and validity of conclusions connected to the data.

## Key Points

 - keep your excel files machine readable and umambiguous
 - don't use formatting to convey information in Excel
 - use tidy data if possible
 - version control takes some effort, but saves a lot of confusion -thus time- in the long run
