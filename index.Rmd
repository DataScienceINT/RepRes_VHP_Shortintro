# Workshop overview

## Why you want to complete this workshop

Research projects are chaotic and we all know how hard it can be to keep track of manuscipt versions, changes to datasets, which figure was generated from which file, etc.. However, when building an data platform such as within VHP4Safety, it is very important that every datapoint can be retraced to its origin.

At the same time, many people store data in a way that works for them, but is almost impossible to reproduce once someone changes jobs. There are some easy systems to implement that conquer this chaos, make your work more productive, collaborations easier, and VHP4Safety possible. And also, save you a lot of time in the long run.


## Learning objectives

After this workshop you:

 - Can store your research projects (data, code, manuscripts, etc) in a future proof way, that fascilitates collaboration, and saves you a lot of time if you ever want to revisit, share or alter your projects. 
 - Know which information needs to be stored with data, and how to keep these together when collaborating with others.
 - Can keep your projects under version control, so you can always backtrace what changed, when, and by whom.
 - Applied all this to your current most active research project
 - Can start tomorrow (or well, next monday) with applying this in your everyday work.

## Contents
