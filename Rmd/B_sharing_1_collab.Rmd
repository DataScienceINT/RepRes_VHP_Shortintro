## Split: sharing data

regular:

 - I donâ€™t use code (R, Python, Matlab, Julia, etc) to analyse my data
 - I would like to use a tidy data format to make my data machine readable
 - I would like to use onedrive / google docs / similar software for version controlling my work.

next level:

 - I use code to analyse my data and already know all about tidy data.
 - I would like to automate my communication of workflows
 - I would like to use github for version controlling my work.

## Exercises regular

 - B1: evaluate your emailing of data / study information. 
 - B2: understanding possible issues when sharing excel files

## Exercises next level

 - B1: evaluate your emailing of data / study information. 
 - C1 + C2 + C3 : get started with github
