## Data flows in ONTOX

Specifics about ontox data workflows here

With very practical starting points.

## version control

 - github?
 
 - version control low-fi without git

note: I will need to do some research on this, as I just throw github at everything. Here is a start:
https://rebelsguidetopm.com/how-to-do-document-version-control/

I propose to split the group here. People with previous coding experience can make a start with github in 1 hou.

People without previous coding experience will have to focus on how to implement version control right now, in a ms-word based environment.
