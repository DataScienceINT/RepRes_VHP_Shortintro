## Version Control, using Github

With very practical starting points.
 - github?
 - version control low-fi without git
note: I will need to do some research on this, as I just throw github at everything. Here is a start:
https://rebelsguidetopm.com/how-to-do-document-version-control/

I propose to split the group here. People with previous coding experience can make a start with github in 1 hou.
**{I prefer spending the time on learning everybody about Github}**
People without previous coding experience will have to focus on how to implement version control right now, in a ms-word based environment.

## Data flows in ONTOX

ONTOX is a data intensive project. Meaning, there is a lot of data collection going on in the project. With so many people collecting data, there is an eminent need for a good protocol. Usually data collection protocols are indicated as workflows which are described as flow diagrams. 

To create a workflow, there is a lot of available software. You could use e.g. [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/nl) or Microsoft Visio. These software solutions are easy to use, but have one disadvantage: They use a Graphical User Interface. As explained previously, GUIs prevent recording of steps and are in that sense not compatible with Reproducible Research. That is why we will use another tool 'Mermaid' to create our workflow. To learn more about Mermaid, follow this [link](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/). The Mermaid syntax is easy to follow and can be implemented in Markdown. The good thing is that Github supports Mermaid natively, meaning that you do not need any additional steps to visualize Mermaid flow diagrams in Github. 

### EXERCISE; Understanding data workflows with Mermaid {.blauw}

For starters we can look at an example workflow that is used within ONTOX by looking at the source file in Github. 

Study the source file of the ONTOX workflow that is called `LiteraturToAOP` [here](https://github.com/ontox-hu/workflows/blob/main/LiteratureToAop.md). To see the source, click on the `raw` button on the top right corner of the file. Try to answer the following questions:

 1. What defines the relationship between two elements in the workflow?
 1. How do you create a box?
 1. How do you create a 'database' element?
 1. How do you put text on an arrow (relationship?)
 1. How do you define a circle in the workflow
 1. What do you need to do to get more relationships pointing TO a box?
 1. What do you need to do to get more relationsships pointing FROM a box?

## Create your own workflow
When collecting or generating data in research, it is good practice to make the process by which data is collected, processed, stored and analysed, visualized and results reported explicit in a workflow. In the exercise below you will start to create a workflow for your own work. 
 
### EXERCISE; Creating your own workflow {.blauw}

In the previous exercise on Github you created a test repository in your own Github account. Here you will create a very simple `mermaid` graph that applies to an element of data collection in your own work

 1. Take a piece of paper and start drawing a simple flow diagram on an element of your data collection that applies to your daily work as a scientist. Limit yourself to a maximum of five elements in your graph. 
 1. Create a repo in your Github account called `my_mermaid`
 1. Add one file to this repo called `workflow.md`
 1. Try recreating the graph you have drawn on paper in this Markdown file
 
**Note: Mind that mermaid graphs are automatically rendered in Github, when stored as code in a Markdown file. To indicate that the code in the file is a mermaid flow diagram you need to add a special start and end line to the beginning and end of your mermaid graph:**

Add 
` ```mermaid `
to the start of your file.
When you want to end the definition of the flow diagram, close the mermaid fragment with:
` ``` `
