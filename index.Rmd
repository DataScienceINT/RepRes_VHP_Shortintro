# Workshop overview

## Why you want to complete this workshop

Here be text including:
 - Research projects are chaotic
 - everyone has trouble keeping track of manuscipt versions
 - almost everyone stores data in a way that works for them, but is almost impossible to reproduce once someone changes jobs.
 - there are some easy systems to implement that conquer this chaos
 - make your work more productive
 - collaborations easier
 - and ontox possible.


## Learning objectives

After this workshop you:

 - Can store your research projects (data, code, manuscripts, etc) in a future proof way, that fascilitates collaboration, and saves you a lot of time if you ever want to revisit, share or alter your projects. 
 - Know which information needs to be stored with data, and how to keep these together when collaborating with others.
 - Can keep your projects under version control, so you can always backtrace what changed, when, and by whom.
 - Applied all this to your current most active research project
 - Can start tomorrow (or well, next monday) with using this workflow in your everyday work.

## Contents 

This workshop is devided in 2 parts: 

Practical Data Handling

 - Folder structure
 - meta data
 
Data sharing

 - Sending others your data or code 
 - Receiving data or code
 - Version control
